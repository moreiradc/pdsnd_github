### Project Title
Bikeshare Project

### Description
This project is part of the Udacity's Programming for Data Science with R Nanodegree Program.
Datasets on a bicycle-sharing system were provided for three American cities, Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. The data cover the first six months of 2017. Students were asked to explore data and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and making visualizations.   

#### Objetives
The aim of this project was to answer the following questions:

* What is the most common day of the week for each city?
* How are different types of trip (round trip or not) distributed throughout the week for each city?
* How are users distributed within age categories for Chicago and New York?
* Is there a relationship between age and trip duration?
